##Week 2: 3D art and design principles
**Description**

**Assignment** 
Pick the one/s that challenge you:
Now that you have had a whirlwind tour play around in unity see what’s there in “add component” (that's at the bottom in the inspector after you click on an object in the hierarchy). Look up short tutorials on stuff that interests you.  Look around at the menus and windows of Unity.

Make progress on your goals so you can tell me about it in class.  I’ll reward significant progress with extra one on one time or doing some research for you if I don’t know something you need. 

Look around you, feel your body… is it tense? ...why?  Wonder about what things inspire you to do stuff or play.  Be inspired by reality for your Virtual worlds. Working too hard?  Think about how could VR make your day easier … or … get out and play a real game in real 3D life with actual real people.  What parts of that fun can you do in VR?.

Folks ready to get advanced with Unity code need to read the scripting introduction in the Unity manual carefully. ( It is not in the scripting api docs by the way).Experienced coders and artist ready to leap forward in code need to read it understand it love it …. It is key for understanding the rest. https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html
