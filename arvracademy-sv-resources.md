**Tools and software you need past Unity: (not covered by class)**

**3d modeling, animation and texturing:**
ZBrush - Best overall for games doesn’t take too long to learn like Maya
Substance Painter - Vital for materials and texturing for Unity.
Modo - made by engineers who actually listened to artists best for modelling
Maya - industry standard best overall best for scientific stuff and super high end (Really tough learning curve).
3DSMax - not recommended unless this is where you started
Mudbox -  good for sculptors for high end movies example: Godzilla.  You can then simplfiy them for games and VR but not as well as ZBrush.
