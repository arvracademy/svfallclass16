**Tools and software you need past Unity: (not covered by class)**

**3d modeling, animation and texturing:**

ZBrush - Best overall for games doesn’t take too long to learn like Maya

Substance Painter - Vital for materials and texturing for Unity.

Modo - made by engineers who actually listened to artists best for modelling
Maya - industry standard best overall best for scientific stuff and super high end (Really tough learning curve).

3DSMax - not recommended unless this is where you started

Mudbox -  good for sculptors for high end movies example: Godzilla.  You can then simplfiy them for games and VR but not as well as ZBrush.
