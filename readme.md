# ARVR Academy - Silicon Valley Fall 2016 - Class Curriculum and Resources

ARVR Academy is an organization dedicated to diversity and inclusion in Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) through education and professional development efforts to make the ARVR industry more accessible to people of all backgrounds. We seek to increase more representation of people from underrepresented communities inclusive of entrepreneurial, technical, and creative roles in the industry. We are working towards an open sourced curriculum of immersive technologies, and aim to help anyone, regardless of prior experience or background, find their spot in the growing AR and VR industries.

This repository has curriculum from our fall class as wells as a list of resources. The resources list includes links with various information helpful for getting started in recommended education, MOOCs (massive open online courses) podcasts, blogs, email lists, events, meetup groups and other organizations Slack channels, and other women in tech resources.
